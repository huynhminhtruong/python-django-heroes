1. Projects vs. apps:
    - What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a Web application that does something – e.g., a Weblog system, a database of public records or a simple poll app. 
    - A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. 
    - A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.

2. Use Django builds CRUD web app manage product: 
    1. Categories: id, name
    2. Supplier: id, name
    3. Products: id, category_id, name, price, image, supplier_id
